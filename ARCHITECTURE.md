# Rustash Architecture Guide

Welcome, architect! This document serves as the blueprint for the Rustash project. It outlines the high-level architecture, design principles, component responsibilities, and the strategic roadmap for its evolution.

## 1. Project Philosophy & Goals

Rustash is more than a snippet manager; it's a testament to quality software engineering, blending modern Rust practices with an innovative AI-driven development workflow.

*   **Local-First & Performant**: All data is stored locally in a single SQLite file, ensuring that the tool is blazing fast and works entirely offline. Performance is a key feature.
*   **Ergonomic CLI**: The command-line interface is designed to be intuitive and powerful, integrating seamlessly into a developer's existing workflow with features like fuzzy finding and clipboard integration.
*   **AI-Driven Development**: The project leverages a sophisticated system of Product Requirement Prompts (PRPs) to guide AI-assisted development, ensuring consistency, quality, and velocity.
*   **Extensible Core**: The core logic is decoupled from the user interface, allowing for future expansion to different frontends (like the planned Tauri desktop app) or even a server-based backend.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

Rustash is structured as a Rust workspace, promoting clear separation of concerns between its different components.

### Crate Responsibilities

*   **`rustash-core`**: The heart of the application. It is a library crate containing all business logic, database interactions (via Diesel), and data models. It is completely UI-agnostic.
*   **`rustash-cli`**: The primary user interface. It's a binary crate that parses command-line arguments (via `clap`), interacts with the user, and calls into `rustash-core` to perform actions.
*   **`rustash-desktop`**: A planned binary crate for a graphical user interface using Tauri. It will reuse `rustash-core` for all its logic.
*   **`macros` & `utils`**: Library crates for shared, reusable code like procedural macros or common utility functions (e.g., configuration management).
*   **`xtask`**: A build-automation crate that provides custom `cargo` commands for linting, testing, and other development tasks.
*   **`PRPs/` & `.claude/`**: The engine of our AI-driven development process, containing structured prompts and configurations for Claude Code.

### Data Flow Example: `rustash add`

1.  **User** runs `rustash add "Title" "Content" --tags rust`.
2.  **`rustash-cli`** (`main.rs`) parses the command using `clap`.
3.  The `AddCommand`'s `execute` method is called.
4.  It creates a `NewSnippet` model from the arguments.
5.  It calls the `add_snippet` function from **`rustash-core`**.
6.  **`rustash-core`** (`snippet.rs`) validates the input.
7.  It uses a `DbConnection` to interact with the database.
8.  A Diesel query inserts the new snippet into the SQLite database.
9.  The newly created `Snippet` (with ID) is returned to the CLI.
10. **`rustash-cli`** formats a success message and prints it to the console.

## 3. Core Library (`rustash-core`) Deep Dive

This crate is the foundation. Its stability and clarity are paramount.

*   **`database.rs`**: Manages the database connection pool (`r2d2`). It correctly handles the default database path and provides connection guards for safe access.
*   **`models.rs`**: Defines the data structures (`Snippet`, `NewSnippet`, etc.) that map to the database schema. The use of `serde` and `diesel` derives is excellent.
*   **`snippet.rs`**: The "service layer" containing all the snippet-related business logic (CRUD, search, placeholder expansion).
*   **`error.rs`**: A well-defined error enum using `thiserror`, which is a best practice for Rust libraries.
*   **`schema.rs`**: Auto-generated by Diesel, correctly not under source control.

### Architectural Refinements

*   **Configuration**: Currently, the database URL is sourced from an environment variable or a hardcoded default. This could be improved by introducing a `Config` struct loaded from a file (e.g., `~/.config/rustash/config.toml`), with environment variables as overrides. The unused `crates/utils/src/config.rs` provides a great starting point for this.
*   **Database Abstraction**: The `sqlite` and `postgres` feature flags are a good start. For true backend independence, we could introduce a `DatabaseService` trait in `rustash-core` that defines the contract for all data operations. Then, we could have `SqliteService` and `PostgresService` implementations. This is a future-facing enhancement to consider as the project grows.
*   **Model Logic**: The `Snippet` struct is a plain data object. It could be enhanced with methods. For example, the logic for parsing the JSON `tags` string into a `Vec<String>` could live on the `Snippet` model itself, promoting encapsulation.

## 4. Command-Line Interface (`rustash-cli`)

The CLI is the face of the application. Its design prioritizes user experience and clarity.

*   **`main.rs` & `commands/`**: A clean implementation using `clap`'s derive macro and subcommands, with each command's logic neatly separated into its own module.
*   **`fuzzy.rs`**: Excellent use of `skim` to provide an interactive fuzzy finder, which significantly enhances usability.
*   **`utils.rs`**: Good separation of concerns, with presentation logic like output formatting isolated from command logic.

### Architectural Refinements

*   **Dependency Management**: The CLI's `db.rs` uses a `lazy_static` global for the connection pool. While effective for a simple CLI, a more explicit pattern would be for `main.rs` to initialize the pool and pass it down to the command handlers. This improves testability and makes the data flow more transparent. For the current scale, the existing approach is acceptable, but this is a key point for future refactoring.
*   **Output Formatting**: The logic for different output formats (`table`, `json`, etc.) has been refactored into the `utils::format_snippet_list` function. This simplifies the command handlers and centralizes all presentation logic.

## 5. Developer Experience (DevX) & Automation

The project's investment in DevX is a significant strength.

*   **AI-Driven Workflow**: The PRP system is a sophisticated and powerful way to ensure high-quality, consistent contributions. It's a defining feature of this project.
*   **`xtask` Build System**: Using `cargo xtask` for build automation is a modern Rust best practice. It keeps all build logic in Rust and is more flexible than shell scripts.
*   **Documentation**: The project has a good set of documentation. To make it even better, we should create a central **`DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`** that serves as an entry point for new contributors, linking to this `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING_WITH_AI.md`, and other relevant resources.

## 6. Architectural Roadmap

## 7. Conclusion

Rustash is built on a solid foundation with a clear separation of concerns between its core logic and user interfaces. The architecture is designed to be both practical for the current feature set and extensible for future growth. By following the roadmap and continuing to invest in documentation and developer experience, Rustash has the potential to become an indispensable tool for developers everywhere.

Remember: Great architecture is not about making the right decisions up front, but about making decisions that are easy to change later. This document, like the code it describes, should evolve over time as the project grows and new requirements emerge.
